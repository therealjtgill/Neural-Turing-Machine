### Neural Turing Machine

Implementation of a Neural Turing Machine based on the paper by [Graves, et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401)

This implementation was a class project for INFO 550 at University of Arizona.

This project includes successful execution of most of the tasks mentioned in the original paper, namely: copy, associative recall, priority sort. In addition to these tasks, I showed that the NTM is also able to perform a version of contrived priority sorting, where patterns are assigned priorities with integer values.
